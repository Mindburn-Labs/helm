# OrgDNA: The Sovereign Specification
OrgDNA is the future-state evolutionary ancestor of OrgGenome. It defines the "Genetic Code" of an autonomous entity, including its purpose, ethical constraints, and cross-generation identity.

## Concepts
- **Telomeres**: Time-bounded validity for high-risk capabilities.
- **Epigenetics**: Environment-aware policy overrides.
- **Morphogenesis**: The process of agents self-organizing under OrgDNA constraints.

## Status
OrgDNA is currently in **SEED** phase. Conformant L1/L2 kernels use OrgGenome (UCS §2).
